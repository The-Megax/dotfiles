I hope these changes will make to Cinnamon core soon so we could rely on framework for loading schemas making all installation steps unneeded. Until then compiling schema manually is still required.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n Installation steps can be found in txt file.<\/p>\n<p>\n thanks and hope you will find extension useful&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n greg<\/p>\n","score":"41","created":"1328097600","last_edited":"1333174502","file":"\/uploads\/extensions\/PKWH-PWYC-MZGS.zip","icon":"\/uploads\/extensions\/OE4U-IBMU-XPSM.png","screenshot":"\/uploads\/extensions\/G46R-GOQN-MKXY.png","author_id":"125","author_user":"greg"},"CoverflowAltTab@dmo60.de":{"spices-id":"3","uuid":"CoverflowAltTab@dmo60.de","name":"Coverflow Alt-Tab","description":"<h1>\n CoverflowAltTab<\/h1>\n<div>\n &nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n CoverflowAltTab&nbsp;let&#39;s you Alt-Tab through your windows in a cover-flow manner.<\/div>\n<div>\n &nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n Originally this was a port of the CoverflowAltTab extension for Gnome-Shell by <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/gnome-shell-extensions-coverflowalttab\/\">palatis<\/a> and the recent rewrite with lots of improvements was done by <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Lusito\">Lusito<\/a>, so a big thanks and all the glory to them!<\/div>\n<div>\n &nbsp;<\/div>\n<h2>\n Installation<\/h2>\n<p>\n Click the download button and extract the zip file.<\/p>\n<div>\n 1) Copy the folder &quot;CoverflowAltTab@dmo60.de&quot; to &quot;~\/.local\/share\/cinnamon\/extensions\/&quot;.<\/div>\n<div>\n &nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n 2) Enable the extension in cinnamon settings.

switcher style (inspired by Windows 7 Super+Tab switcher)<br \/>\n + improved animations<br \/>\n + theming improvements (we finally have a decent window title theming)<br \/>\n + multi-monitor improvements (should be usable now for most of you, but still with some problems... clutter is giving us a hard time here)<br \/>\n + support for new Cinnamon 1.8. settings API, until then, you have to edit config.js file to set your preferences (no more need to restart Cinnamon!)<br \/>\n + probably more I can&#39;t remember :)<\/p>\n<p>\n <strong>- V 1.5.1 -<\/strong><br \/>\n (11.02.2013)<br \/>\n + fixed animation when activating a minimized window<\/p>\n<p>\n <strong>- V 1.5 -<\/strong><br \/>\n (09.02.2013)<br \/>\n Changes only in Cinnamon 1.6 version!<br \/>\n + new background style: removed gradient, use dimed background instead<br \/>\n + new window title label style: since there was no style class that made the title box look pretty for most of the themes, I removed it and now use a self-defined one (per default it&#39;s quite simple, but you can adjust it by modifying the stylesheet.css file or themers can define it in their themes!)<br \/>\n + hide the panel per default<br \/>\n + fixed Coverflow sometimes doesn&#39;t update when closing a window with &#39;q&#39;<br \/>\n + improved appearance on multi-monitor setups, still not good though (positioning is fixed, but perspective still messed up)<br \/>\n + new preference options that can be set in &#39;switcher.js&#39;
